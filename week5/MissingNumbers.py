"""
Challenge:
Given two arrays, `arr` and `brr`, representing lists of integers, you are tasked with finding the missing numbers. Array `brr` represents the original list, while `arr` is a modified version that might be missing some numbers or have some elements with a lower frequency than in `brr`. The function must return a sorted list of the missing numbers or numbers with lower frequency in `arr`.

    Args:
    arr (list): A list of integers (the modified list).
    brr (list): A list of integers (the original list).

    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of integers that are missing or appear fewer times in `arr` compared to `brr`.

    # Count the frequency of each number in both arrays

brr = [7, 2, 5, 4, 6, 3, 5, 3]
print(missingNumbers(arr, brr))  # Output: [4, 6]
