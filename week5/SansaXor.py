Challenge:
Given an array of integers, compute the XOR of all possible subarrays. However, instead of calculating all possible subarrays directly, you can derive a simplified approach. If the array length is odd, XOR all elements that appear an odd number of times in the subarrays. If the array length is even, the result is 0.

Function Description:
If the length of the array is even, all elements appear an even number of times in subarrays, so the result is 0. If the length of the array is odd, only elements at odd indices (including 0) contribute to the result.
